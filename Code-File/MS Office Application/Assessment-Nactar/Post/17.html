It is important to note that no plagiarism checker is perfect. The accuracy of a plagiarism checker depends on a number of factors, including the size of the database it uses, the algorithm it uses to detect plagiarism, and the type of text being checked.

If you are looking for a free plagiarism checker that is accurate and easy to use, I recommend trying Grammarly, Quetext, or Plagiarisma.
